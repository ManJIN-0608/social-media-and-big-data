# social-media-and-big-data
In this project, you are required to think about a case study, in which you can apply social media analytics to gain insight about how a certain artist or band can improve their popularity. You will need to describe the setting for your case study, apply social media analytics using the tools introduced during the labs, and evaluate your findings and determine appropriate future actions.

- Choose data sources and data that are appropriate for your case study.
- Pay attention to how much data you retrieve and how frequently you retrieve data. If you try to get lots of data often, the APIs will impose a rate-limit on your account. However, you can still proceed after the rate-limit has ended.
- Use the software introduced in the labs (RStudio, Tableauâ€¦).
- Add headings in your R scripts so that we can easily find the code related to each question.
- Export all datasets as .RData files (so that we can re-run your code if needed).
- Add screenshots of your results.
- Make plots/visualisations wherever possible, using R functions, Gephi, and Tableau. (Most results can be displayed as a plot/visualisation!)
